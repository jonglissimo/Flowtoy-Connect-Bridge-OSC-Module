# Flowtoys Connect Bridge OSC Module

This chataigne module let's you control Flowtoys vision props (e.g. Vision club, Capsule 2.0) through a Flowtoys Connect Bridge OSC protocol. The bridge is a separate hardware device through which your computer or smartphone can act as a remote control. It's based on a ESP32.
